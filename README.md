## Inspired By

This project was **inspired by the amazing portfolio of Ali Sanati**, both his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Ali-Sanati/Portfolio) and the [YouTube video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9UQItTpwUQ).
All credit for the original layout, 3D ideas, and animation effects goes to him — this project is my **personal adaptation and implementation**.
